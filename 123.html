    <title>Causes of Illetracy in Pakistan </title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <p>Illiteracy in Pakistan is caused by several social, economic, and administrative factors. Poverty forces many families to send their children to work instead of school, while the lack of educational facilities in rural and backward areas limits access to education. Gender discrimination and child labor further increase illiteracy, especially among girls. In addition, low government spending, weak education policies, untrained teachers, and outdated curricula reduce the quality of education and lead to high dropout rates. Political instability and lack of awareness about the importance of education also contribute to this serious problem.
