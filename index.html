    <p><i>My today's topic is ILLETRACY in Pakistan. It is one of the most serious problem affecting Pakistan both economically and socially.Pakistan is facing this problem since its creation. It affects Pakistan's image at international level.
Illiteracy in Pakistan has far-reaching impacts. It hits the economy with lower productivity and limited job prospects 💸. Social gaps widen as healthcare and rights awareness suffer 🚑. Women face extra hurdles, worsening the gender divide 👩. Innovation and tech adoption lag, slowing growth 🚀. This creates cycles of poverty, poor health, and less opportunity 🔄.
<br>
Digging deeper:
- *Social*: Strained communities, limited civic engagement 🗣️
<br>
- *Economic*: Reduced earning potential, bigger poverty risk 💔
<br>
- *Gender gap*: Women’s participation in workforce drops 👩‍💼
<br>
- *Growth*: Slower innovation, brain drain 🚀
<br>

Breaking this cycle needs focus on education 📚. Boosting literacy could unlock opportunities, empowering individuals and driving national growth 🌈. </i>
